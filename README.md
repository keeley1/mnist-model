# mnist-model
Creating a model that successfully classifies images of numbers from 0 - 9, using the famous MNIST dataset.

The MNIST dataset has been referred to as the "Hello World" of machine learning, credited as one of the first datasets that proved the effectiveness of neural networks, it is still commonly used in scientific papers.

This notebook follows the universal workflow as described in "Deep Learning with Python" by Fran√ßois Chollet. It involves the creation of a model, testing the baseline accuracy, and aiming to beat this accuracy by training the model with training and validation datasets. Then, to improve accuracy and reduce loss, experimenting with tuning different hyperparameters such as number of epochs, number of neurons in a layer, and number of layers.
